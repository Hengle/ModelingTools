Generalized Observations input file structure:
1. Comments (lines starting with #)

2. Number of cell groups, SINGLE or DOUBLE precision, STRUCTURED or UNSTRUCTURED

(repeat the data sets 3-3 for each cell group)
3. number of observation times, number of cells, Flow type (use quotes if needed around flow type), [Uniform factor]

4. (One line for each observation time) 
OBSNAM IREFSP TOFFSET FLWOBS 

5. (One line for each cell)
(if structured)
LAYER ROW COLUMN Order [FACTOR] (order is used to distinguish between multiple boundaries of the same type in the same cell. If LAYER is -1, LAYER is not ignored. The latter option is present because SFR streams can change layers if the layer they are in dries out.)
(if unstructured)
CELL_NUMBER Order [FACTOR] (order is used to distinguish between multiple boundaries of the same type in the same cell.)

Generalized Observations output file structure:
(one line for each observation)
Simulated value, observed value, observation name
