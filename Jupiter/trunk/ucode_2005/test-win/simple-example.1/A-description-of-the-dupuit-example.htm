  Comment: All files are included in one directory. Only regression automated 
  <br>
  analyses are performed. New users requested a very simple exmaple.<br>
  All input is in ucode_dupuit.in. The model is dupuit.exe and solves<br>
  for head in a<a href="html/dupuit.htm"> system with a horizontal no-flow lower 
  boundary, fixed<br>
  head on the left and right, and a recahrge flux on the top boundary.</a><br>
  This is presented in most beginning ground water books and is <br>
  illustrated with dupuit.htm in: simple-example.1/html/dupuit.htm.<br>
  <br>
  <b>ucode_dupuit.bat runs the regression based on input in ucode_dupuit.in</b><br>
  <br>
  ucode_dupuit.in directs ucode to substitute parameter values in<br>
  dupuit.in.tpl, execute dupuit.bat (which runs the dupuit code in the <br>
  code_dupuit folder and generates output dupuit.out in the folder<br>
  simple-example.1), then based on the instructions in ucode_dupuit.ins<br>
  ucode extracts the results of the simulation from dupuit.out and uses<br>
  those values to calculate residuals and sensitivities, ucode <br>
  iteratively uses residuals and sensitivities to update the parameters <br>
  and repeats until the parameters change less than tolpar. If ucode is <br>
  successful, default residual analyses are executed from <br>
  ucode_dupuit.bat <br>
  <br>
  <b>The observation data provided include a small amount of noise. <br>
  Values below are in meters and days</b><br>
  The true heads and flow at the left and right boundary:<br>
  <b>heads from left to right at<br>
  5m, 15m, 25m, 35m, 45m are:</b><br>
  5.50475 5.89724 5.81146 5.22393 3.91489<br>
  <b>with noise as entered for observations in the regression they are:<br>
  5.505 5.897 5.812 5.223 3.915</b><br>
  <b>flow at the left boundary</b> is:<br>
  -0.00498<br>
  <b>with noise as entered in the regression:<br>
  -0.0050</b><br>
  <b>flow at the right boundary</b> is:<br>
  0.00872<br>
  <b>with noise as entered in the regression:<br>
  0.0088</b><br>
  <br>
  New users may wish to experiment with alternative observations which <br>
  can be generated by running the forward model with altered input in <br>
  dupuit.in and getting the results from dupuit.out.<br>
  <br>
  New users may also experiment with estimating other parameters, such as <br>
  the heads at the boundaries in various combinations with K and w.<br>
  <br>
  One might also experiment with various settings in the ucode input.<br>
  <br>
  Notice that if the flow is not included as an onservation in the <br>
  regression then only the ratio of K and W can be estimated, not <br>
  their absolute values because the parameters are completely correlated <br>
  when only heads are used as observations.</font>
