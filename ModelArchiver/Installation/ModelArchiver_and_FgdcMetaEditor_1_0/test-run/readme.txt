This archive contains two folders with models. Both models come as examples along with ModelMuse. You can find 
more information about them there. The rma folder is a simplified model of the Rocky Mountain Arsenal by Hornberger and Konikow (1998). The WaterSupply model is based on an example from Andersen (1993).


The example archive does not fully conform to the USGS archiving requirements in the following respects.

1. To keep the archive small,the model executables and the source code have been excluded from the archive. 

2. The Shapefile for the archive only outlines the Rocky Mountain Arsenal model and is not properly georeferenced.
In archives that contain multiple models, the Shapefile should encompass all the included models.

3. There is no modelgeoref.txt file.

4. The archive does not include a digital object identifier and instructions on how to run the models.
