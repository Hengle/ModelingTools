For distribution, be sure to compile accjupiter.dll on SPANKY (igskahcwws095), not ODO (igskahcwlterb2).  

Odo has VS2008 and IVF 11.1.
Spanky has VS2010 and IVF Composer XE 2013

When Odo/VS2008/IVF11 is used, the resulting accjupiter.dll causes ModelMate not to start up (see emails with Jeff Kennedy, ~1/8/2014).  It won't run on Spanky.

I have not found a combination of compiler/linker options that allows accjupiter.dll built on Odo/VS2008/IVF11 to work on Spanky.
