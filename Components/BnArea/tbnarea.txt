TTBNArea allows you to easily use the Taskbar Notification Area
of Windows 95.



Properties:

Enabled: boolean

Icon: TIcon
The icon that appears in Taskbar Notification Area.

PopupOnBoth: boolean
If true, PopupMenuL pops up on left and on right click no 
matter if PopupMenuR is assigned or not. 

PopupMenuL: TPopupMenu
PopupMenuR: TPopupMenu
Here you can assign separate popup menues for the left and
right mouse button.

Tip: string;
Hint appearing when you move the mouse over the icon.



Events:

OnLeftClick, OnRightClick: TNotifyEvent
These events are only fired if the corresponding mouse button is not
used for the popup menu.

OnDblClick: TNotifyEvent
Occurs on double-clicking with the left mouse button, no
matter whether a popup menu is assigned or not.

OnChanging: TChangingEvent ( = procedure(Sender: TObject; ChangeKind: TChangeKind;
    var AllowChange: boolean) of object)
Fired before Tip or Icon are changed.

OnChange: TChangeEvent ( = procedure(Sender: TObject; ChangeKind: TChangeKind) of object)
Fired after Tip or Icon have been changed. Logically, it is not fired when AllowChange
in the OnChanging event is set to false.
