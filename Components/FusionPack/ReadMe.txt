About:
In short, I've collected and "fused" (combined) many components.
For example, I made a history edit, then found the edit that
accepts only numbers, then an transparent edit and so on.
But what if you want a transparent edit with history?
Also, after downloading a bunch of components from DSP, the palette
became overcrowded. I think that it is better to have more
versatile components.

Authors:
I gave my best to state all the authors, and their contribution.

Freeware:
All components are provided as is, with full source code available. 
All initial (pre-fused) code was declared to be freeware. 
All standard freeware rules apply - the authors cannot be held responsible 
for any software or hardware failures, data loss or stress. You are allowed 
to use this package for any (ethical) purpose. Redistribution of this 
package and its components is allowed and welcome but you cannot sell 
it unless you make significant changes and improve its quality. Even then, 
all credits and info must be kept in the product. If you redistribute this 
package, all included files must be present. If you use this package, your 
only obligation is to mention the authors of used components in your 
program's about box.

Having problems?
First, take a look at my list of problems and bugs. If your problem or 
the bug you found isn't already listed, mail it to me and I'll try to deal 
with it. If it is listed, that means that I'm either trying to solve it 
myself or I'm waiting for someone else to do that for me.

Any ideas?
All ideas for improvement of these components are welcome. If you made
or found a useful component that could be fused with some of these,
send it to me. Make sure it is freeware. Important: please don't send
me compiled units or exe-s, I want only source and resource files (for
Delphi 3, preferable).

Requirements:
Well, I can only guarantee that these components work on Delphi3. They
should work on D4, and I don't know about D2 or D1. If you try them on 
older versions, I'll be glad to receive info on that. If
you adapt some of them to work on these versions, even better.

Special terms:
There are some things I need help with. If you are using this package, and 
you know how to help me, then I'm counting on your help!!! You can find a 
list of problems and bugs on my site so send me some solutions.
