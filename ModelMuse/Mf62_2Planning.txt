Questions
	Time steps can be different in flow and transport. If different, could a stress period have two steps for flow and three for transport?
	Can a MODFLOW-2005 or MODFLOW-NWT flow model be linked with a MODFLOW 6 GWT model? Some of the statements in the FMI package description seem to imply that this is possible. However, I worry that the binary output from those models might be single precision whereas MODFLOW 6 would expect them to be double-precision.

	Requires density or concentrations to be specified for boundaries.
