ModelMuse is a graphical user interface (GUI) for the U.S. Geological Survey
(USGS) models MODFLOW 6, MODFLOW–2005, MODFLOW-LGR, MODFLOW-LGR2, MODFLOW-NWT,
 MODFLOW-CFP, MODFLOW-OWHM, MODPATH, ZONEBUDGET, PHAST, SUTRA, MT3D-USGS, and 
WellFootprint and the non-USGS model MT3DMS.  This software package 
provides a GUI for creating the flow and transport input file for PHAST and the 
input files for the other models. In 
ModelMuse, the spatial data for the model are independent of the grid, and the 
temporal data are independent of the stress periods. Being able to input these 
data independently allows the user to redefine the spatial and temporal 
discretization at will. This report describes the basic concepts required to work 
with ModelMuse. These basic concepts include the model grid, data sets, formulas, 
objects, the method used to assign values to data sets, and model features.

The ModelMuse main window has a top, front, and side view of the model that can 
be used for editing the model, and a 3–D view of the model that can be used to 
display properties of the model. The side view is hidden for SUTRA models. Only 
the top view is visible for WellFootprint projects.
ModelMuse has tools to generate and edit the 
model grid. It also has a variety of interpolation methods and geographic 
functions that can be used to help define the spatial variability of the model. 
ModelMuse can be used to execute the models and can also display the results of 
all the models except PHAST and ZONEBUDGET. An example of using 
ModelMuse with  MODFLOW–2005 is included in the report. Several additional examples 
are described in the help system for ModelMuse, which can be accessed from the Help 
menu.

This report (1) describes modifications to ModelMuse,as described in U.S. Geological 
Survey (USGS) Techniques and Methods (TM) 6–A29 (Winston, 2009), to add support for 
the Saturated-Unsaturated Transport model (SUTRA) (Voss and Provost, 2002; version 
of September 22, 2010) and (2) supplements USGS TM 6–A29. Modifications include 
changes to the main ModelMuse window where the model is designed, addition of methods 
for generating a finite-element mesh suitable for SUTRA, defining how some functions 
should apply when using a finite-element mesh rather than a finite-difference grid 
(as originally programmed in ModelMuse), and applying spatial interpolation to angles. 
In addition, the report describes ways of handling objects on the front view of the 
model and displaying data. A tabulation contains a summary of the new or modified 
dialog boxes.

ModelMuse, a graphical user interface for groundwater-modeling software, was modified 
to support MODFLOW 6. ModelMuse works with two types of spatial discretization in 
MODFLOW 6: structured grids (DIS) and discretization by vertices (DISV). Quadtree 
refinement is used to generate a DISV model from a structured-grid model. The locations 
and weights for ghost nodes used to improve DISV model accuracy are computed automatically 
by ModelMuse using a new algorithm. ModelMuse does not support other types of DISV grids 
and unstructured grids. ModelMuse supports options in MODFLOW 6 that designate individual 
cells as confined or convertible and remove inactive cells associated with discontinuous 
layers, thereby reducing the computational burden. ModelMuse can specify fully 
three-dimensional (3D), spatially variable anisotropy in hydraulic conductivity. Although 
MODFLOW 6 does not support the parameters supported by MODFLOW–2005, ModelMuse provides 
backward compatibility by allowing ModelMuse parameters to specify scale-factor variables 
in MODFLOW 6 time-series files within packages that support time-series files. ModelMuse 
can automatically convert the data for many of the packages from other MODFLOW models to 
the new data for these packages in MODFLOW 6. Some packages, such as the Streamflow 
Routing (SFR) package, changed significantly enough that only a partial conversion is 
possible. Head and flow observations in older models are also converted to observation 
locations in the MODFLOW 6 Observation Utility. ModelMuse accommodates the ability of 
MODFLOW 6 to store specific discharge components by allowing the user to visualize the 
components of a specific discharge on the model grid. ModelMuse supports the versions 
of MODPATH and ZONEBUDGET compatible with MODFLOW 6.
